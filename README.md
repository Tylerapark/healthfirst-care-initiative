# HealthFirst Care Initiative — Portfolio Project

A comprehensive business analysis and digital transformation project aimed at improving patient scheduling, resource management, and communication at a healthcare organization. This project demonstrates my skills in business requirements gathering, stakeholder management, process modeling, and data-driven decision-making using SQL, Python, and Google Looker Studio.

## About This Project

HealthFirst Care faced significant operational challenges, including long patient wait times, inefficient scheduling, and communication gaps. Through detailed analysis and stakeholder engagement, I developed a solution framework focused on:

- Automating appointment scheduling with conflict detection  
- Implementing real-time notifications to improve patient satisfaction  
- Streamlining inter-departmental communication  
- Optimizing resource allocation with real-time visibility  
- Ensuring system usability and HIPAA compliance

## My Role & Contributions

- Conducted comprehensive stakeholder analysis and engagement planning  
- Gathered and documented detailed business and functional requirements  
- Extracted, cleaned, and analyzed healthcare datasets using SQL and Python to identify bottlenecks and validate requirements  
- Created As-Is and To-Be process models to visualize current challenges and proposed improvements  
- Developed interactive dashboards in Google Looker Studio to provide stakeholders with real-time insights into scheduling efficiency and resource availability  
- Developed a project scope management plan aligning objectives with constraints  
- Prioritized requirements using MoSCoW methodology  
- Designed clear documentation to communicate findings and recommendations
